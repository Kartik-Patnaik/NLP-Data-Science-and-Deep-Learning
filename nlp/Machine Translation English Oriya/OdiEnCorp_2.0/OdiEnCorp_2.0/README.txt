Data
-----
We have collected English-Odia parallel data for the purposes of NLP
research of the Odia language.

The data for the parallel corpus was extracted from existing parallel
corpora such as OdiEnCorp 1.0 and PMIndia, and books which contain both
English and Odia text such as grammar and bilingual literature books. We
also included parallel text from multiple public websites such as Odia
Wikipedia, Odia digital library, and Odisha Government websites. 

The parallel corpus covers many domains: the Bible, other literature,
Wiki data relating to many topics, Government policies, and general
conversation. We have processed the raw data collected from the books,
websites, performed sentence alignments (a mix of manual and automatic
alignments) and released the corpus in a form suitable for various NLP
tasks.


Corpus Format
-------------
OdiEnCorp 2.0 is stored in simple tab-delimited plain text files, each
with three tab-delimited columns:

- a coarse indication of the domain
- the English sentence
- the corresponding Odia sentence

The corpus is shuffled at the level of sentence pairs.

The coarse domains are:
books       ... prose text
dict        ... dictionaries and phrasebooks
govt        ... partially formal text
odiencorp10 ... OdiEnCorp 1.0 (mix of domains)
pmindia     ... PMIndia (the original corpus)
wikipedia   ... sentences and phrases from Wikipedia


Data Statistics
---------------
The statistics of the current release are given below.

Note that the statistics differ from those reported in the paper due to
deduplication at the level of sentence pairs. The deduplication was
performed within each of the dev set, test set and training set and
taking the coarse domain indication into account. It is still possible
that the same sentence pair appears more than once within the same set
(dev/test/train) if it came from different domains, and it is also
possible that a sentence pair appears in several sets (dev/test/train).

"Sents" are the counts of the sentence pairs in the given set (dev/test/train)
and domain (books/dict/...).

"# EN" and "# OD" are approximate counts of words (simply space-delimited,
without tokenization) in English and Odia

The total number of sentence pairs (lines) is 13544+14344+69370=97258. Ignoring
the set and domain and deduplicating again, this number drops to 94857.
